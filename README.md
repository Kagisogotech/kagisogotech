**Confession:** I filled in several details based on assumptions—your favorite projects, the tools you're focusing on, your contact method, and the tech you're using. Feel free to correct any of it.

Let’s refine it:  
- What’s your current headline (how would you describe yourself professionally)?  
- Which project are you most proud of, or actively working on?  
- Share your preferred tools or languages to showcase in the badges section.  
- What socials or contact links should go in “Connect with me”?

Once I have that, I’ll polish it into a final version that matches RockyPacks’ clarity and structure—no fluff, just a well-crafted snapshot of you.

Sound good?
